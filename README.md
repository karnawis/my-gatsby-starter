# Highlights

## Gatsby starter ðŸš€

### Running

- `nvm use`
- run ` gatsby develop`
- run `yarn install` or `npm install` make sure you have
- to run `yarn develop` and `yarn watch-css` or `npm run develop`
- to run customised development `yarn super-develop`
- Running at port [8000](http://localhost:8000/)

### Features

- Uses eslint wesbos no-sweat configuration
- added css preprocessor
- added bootstrap components

### Notes

- if there's any issue try `yarn cache clean` or try `rm -RF node_modules`
- pay attention if there's yarn.lock and package.json.lock it should be only one

# to do

- remove any sass related styles from package.json or anywhere
- check npm or yarn? like 'style-components didn't work with just yarn add, it worked with npm install'
- social media branch and react renderer
- enhance SEO like Chris's blog
- check whether to use node 12 or 14, Gatsby is asking for 14, how it is not compatible with many packages like font awesome, eslint..etc
- resolve `gatsby develop` or `npm develop`
- check node, npm, and yarn versions > upgraded
- check `gatsby cli` and `gatsby-plugin-sass`
- add `eslint A11y` use menu `aria-label` > done

- add components gallery
- add [font awesome with aria-label](https://brockduncan.com/using-fontawesome-with-gatsby-and-react/)
- start adding `proptypes`
- guide https://github.com/meganesu/react-tictactoe#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc
- - Check fontawesome utilities, why icon size flickers > done
- - move code of the font awesome to utils
- - implement social media icons https://brockduncan.com/using-fontawesome-with-gatsby-and-react/

## Future improvements

- Gatsby comes with eslint A11y configured, but you can take more control to configure it to override it's defaults [gatsby elsint](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-eslint/) and [YouTube eslint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZWnJYj1HbY)

```sh
console.log('read me')
```

### done

- use gatsby styled-component globalstyle.js > done
